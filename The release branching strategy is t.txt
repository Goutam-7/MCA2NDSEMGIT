The release branching strategy is typically employed in software development when preparing to release a new version of the software to users. It involves creating a separate branch from the main development branch (e.g., `develop`) specifically for stabilizing and preparing the codebase for release. This release branch is often named after the version number of the upcoming release (e.g., `release-1.0`).

The release branching strategy is typically employed in the following scenarios:

1. **Preparation for Release:** When a software project reaches a stage where it is ready for release to users, a release branch is created to stabilize the codebase and prepare it for production deployment.

2. **Feature Freeze:** Once the release branch is created, developers typically refrain from adding new features to the codebase. Instead, the focus shifts to fixing bugs, addressing issues, and performing final testing to ensure the stability and quality of the release.

3. **Parallel Maintenance:** While the release branch is being prepared for release, development work on new features and enhancements can continue on separate feature branches. This allows for parallel development without disrupting the stability of the release branch.

4. **Hotfixes:** If critical bugs or security vulnerabilities are discovered in the release branch during the stabilization phase, hotfixes can be applied directly to the release branch to address these issues without waiting for the next release.

Benefits of the release branching strategy include:

1. **Isolation of Release Preparation:** By creating a separate release branch, development and stabilization activities for the upcoming release are isolated from ongoing development work on new features. This separation helps maintain stability and ensures that the release process is not disrupted by ongoing changes.

2. **Risk Mitigation:** The release branch provides a controlled environment for final testing, bug fixing, and quality assurance activities before the release is deployed to production. This helps mitigate the risk of introducing regressions or critical issues in the production environment.

3. **Flexibility:** The release branch allows for flexibility in managing the release process. It enables teams to stabilize the codebase at their own pace, perform necessary testing and bug fixing, and make last-minute adjustments as needed before the release is deployed.

4. **Versioning and Traceability:** Using release branches with version-specific names (e.g., `release-1.0`) provides clear versioning and traceability throughout the development lifecycle. It helps track changes related to specific releases and facilitates maintenance and support activities for each version of the software.

Overall, the release branching strategy provides a structured approach to preparing and deploying software releases, enabling teams to deliver high-quality releases to users with reduced risk and increased confidence.
