The forking workflow is commonly used in open-source projects where contributors do not have direct write access to the main repository. Instead, they fork the main repository, make changes in their forked repository, and then submit a pull request to the main repository to propose their changes. Here are the steps involved in creating a new branch and pushing changes in the forking workflow:

1. **Fork the Main Repository:**
   - Navigate to the main repository on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
   - Click on the "Fork" button to create a copy (fork) of the main repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository:**
   - Copy the URL of your forked repository.
   - Open your terminal or Git Bash.
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of your forked repository to clone it to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone <forked_repository_url>
     ```
   
3. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Change your working directory to the cloned repository:
     ```
     cd <forked_repository_name>
     ```
   - Create a new branch for your changes using the `git checkout -b` command:
     ```
     git checkout -b <branch_name>
     ```
     Replace `<branch_name>` with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/new-feature`).

4. **Make Changes:**
   - Make the desired changes to the files in your local repository using a text editor or an IDE.

5. **Stage and Commit Changes:**
   - Stage the changes you want to commit using the `git add` command:
     ```
     git add <file1> <file2> ...
     ```
     Alternatively, you can use `git add .` to stage all changes.
   - Commit the staged changes with a descriptive commit message:
     ```
     git commit -m "Your commit message here"
     ```

6. **Push Changes to Your Fork:**
   - Push the committed changes from your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
     ```
     git push origin <branch_name>
     ```
     Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you created in step 3.

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Compare & pull request" button next to the branch you just pushed.
   - Review the changes, add a title and description to your pull request, and then click on the "Create pull request" button.
   - Your pull request will be submitted to the main repository for review by the project maintainers.

8. **Syncing with Upstream (Optional):**
   - If there have been changes in the main repository since you forked it, you may want to sync your fork with the upstream repository to incorporate those changes into your local repository. You can do this by adding the upstream repository as a remote and fetching its changes.

These steps outline the process of creating a new branch and pushing changes in the forking workflow. It allows contributors to make changes without directly affecting the main repository and facilitates collaboration through pull requests.
